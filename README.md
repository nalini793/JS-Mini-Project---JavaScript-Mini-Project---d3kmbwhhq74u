For those of you not familiar with Ping Pong, it's a ball game played by two paddles. Ball goes back & forth between opponents and players tries to avoid any miss to win the game.

<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<h2 id="overview"> :cloud: Overview</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
In this project, I've enabled sound effects for Start/Restart button, ball hitting paddle and also ball hitting the wall along with when someone loses the game (when balls touch upper or lower wall).

<p align="justify"> 

As it is a 2 player game, user can contol both the paddles representing Player 1 and Player 2 from keyboard.<br>
  The command keys are as follows:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>For Player 1: To move right - right arrow key | To move left - left arrow key</li>
    <li>For Player 2: To move right - a key | To move left - s key</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

 <h4 id="flow"> :small_orange_diamond: Flow:</h2>
<p align="justify"> 

Ball is suspended in the middle before the game starts.<br>
As you press Start button, animation starts and ball starts moving down towards player 1;<br>
As player 1 strikes the ball, Right-Left angle gets calculated in which ball will traverse back upwards; and as the player 2 strikes the same thing happens again.<br> Whenever a player misses the ball and ball hits the defending wall; the said player loses and opposite one wins.<br>
Restart page displays winner player.
