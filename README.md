About The Project
For those of you not familiar with Ping Pong, it's a ball game played by two paddles. Ball goes back & forth between opponents and players tries to avoid any miss to win the game.

Overview
In this project, I've enabled sound effects for Start/Restart button, ball hitting paddle and also ball hitting the wall along with when someone loses the game (when balls touch upper or lower wall).

Controls:
As it is a 2 player game, user can contol both the paddles representing Player 1 and Player 2 from keyboard. The command keys are as follows:
For Player 1: To move right - right arrow key | To move left - left arrow key
For Player 2: To move right - a key | To move left - s key

Flow:

Ball is suspended in the middle before the game starts.
As you press Start button, animation starts and ball starts moving down towards player 1;
As player 1 strikes the ball, Right-Left angle gets calculated in which ball will traverse back upwards; and as the player 2 strikes the same thing happens again. Whenever a player misses the ball and ball hits the defending wall; the said player loses and opposite one wins.
Restart page displays winner player.
